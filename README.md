# React Query Demo

## Introduction

This is a demo React app that demonstrates the use of `react-query` to fetch, create, and display posts using mock data. The task is to add pagination functionality for fetching posts, simulating an API behavior where only a subset of posts are fetched at a time.

## Task 1: Implement Paginated Queries

Your task is to implement pagination for the post list. This will allow the app to load posts in chunks (e.g., 5 posts at a time), with the ability to load more posts as the user scrolls down or clicks a "Load More" button.

## Task 2: Implement Infinite Query

Use `useInfiniteQuery` to implement infinte queries. This will allow the app to load posts in batches (e.g., 5 posts at a time), automatically fetching more posts as the user scrolls down
